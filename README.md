## Fast, Redis-based, Write-Time Activity Feed for Social Networks

This is a "from-the-ground-up" write-up of the activity feed concept, that hopes to fulfill the following purpose:

 * To define a minimalistic API for a typical event-based News Feed (a.k.a. Activity Feed)
 * To provide a scalable default backend implementation using Redis
 * To allow connecting the application to multiple independent activity feeds that may or may not share Redis backend.

### Key Features

The following is a short list of high-level features intended to be supported:

1. Updating the feed is generally done for a set of users. Typical example being an event distributed to all followers. Here we support:

    * _Publishing_ a new event to all related users.
    * _Deleting_ an event from all related user feeds.
    * _Aggregating_ similar events within each user's feed (not planned for v1.0)

3. Reading the feed is done for a given user with the purpose of rendering the news feed.

    * Fetching and _paginating_ the news feed items for the purpose of rendering them on the UI.
    * _Saving the last viewing time_ for a given user.
    * Fast, _constant time read operations_ on the news feed, for any user due to it's pre-computed design.
    * Redis backend Compatibility with [`twemproxy`](https://github.com/twitter/twemproxy), and it's ability to shard Redis backend, and to support massive data sets across any number of servers
    * Quick lookup of the _number of the new (unread)_ items in the user's feed

It is my hope to keep this gem small and very targeted to solving a specific problem, which is **to define a basic activity feed API for reading and writing from/to a backend, which can be swapped out with another implementation.**

### Design

This feed works best in a combination with application events, using any event-dispatching framework such as [Ventable](https://github.com/kigster/ventable), or [Wisper](https://github.com/krisleech/wisper).  As events are dispatched, an application component that generates activity feed must subscribe to a subset of the events â€” those that must appear in the feed. The events are typically converted to a compact string-based schema, and stored in Redis using several internal data structures.

This is a _write-time_ activity-feed implementation, where the speed optimization is focused on the _read-time_ performance, and the majority of the work is performed when the event is actually published. When the user requests their feed, it is constructed by returning the rendered versions of the events stored in the user's feed. Because the feed is pre-computed, the rendering phase should be very quick, making users happy with a snappy activity feed in the application.


#### Speed vs Real-time Trade-Off

The trade-off here is a possible delay in receiving an event in your feed. Because most of the work is performed at the event generation time, it must update feeds of all users who are subscribed to (or follow) a user (or any other model) that generated the event. If your system allows large audiences (eg, Twitter's celebrities have many millions of followers), then this approach suffers from a 'Bieber Problem'. For more information on the differences between _write-time_ and _read-time_ activity feed, please read [the following blog post by Lee Byron, Facebook](https://hashnode.com/post/architecture-how-would-you-go-about-building-an-activity-feed-like-facebook-cioe6ea7q017aru53phul68t1/answer/ciol0lbaa02q52s530vfqea0t)

Events can be a pure ruby classes, as long as they respond to the required methods (see below). They should also be able to render themselves in whatever formats needed, in order to show up within the application, but this functionality is outside of the scope of this gem.


## Usage

First you need to configure the Feed with a valid backend implementation.

### Configuration

```ruby
  require 'active_feed'
  require 'redis'

  ActiveFeed.configure do |config|
     config[:news_feed].backend = ActiveFeed::Backend::Redis.new(
       redis: ::Redis.new(host: '127.0.0.1')
     )
     config[:news_feed].per_page = 20
  end
```

Above we've configured the Redis client, sent it over to the Redis Backend, which then initialized, and
became the default implementation for this particular news feed.

#### Multiple Independent Activity Feeds


But sometimes a single feed is not enough. What if we wanted to maintain two separate personalized feeds for each user: one would be news articles the user subscribes to, and the other would be a more typical activity feed.

We can create an additional activity feed, say for followers, and call it `:followers` at the same time, and configure it with a slightly different backend. Because we expect this activity feed to be more taxing, we'll wrap it in the `ConnectionPool` that will create several connections that can be used concurrently:

```ruby
require 'active_feed'
require 'redis'

ActiveFeed.configure do |config|

  # This is the feed of news articles based on user subscription preferences.

  config[:news_feed].backend = ActiveFeed::Backend::Redis.new(
    redis: ::Redis.new(host: '127.0.0.1')
  )
  config[:news_feed].per_page = 20
  config[:news_feed].delimeter = '|'


  # This is the feed of events associated with the followers.
  # We use ConnectionPool because we anticipate higher load.

  config[:followers].backend = ActiveFeed::Backend::Redis.new(
    redis: ConnectionPool.new(size: 5, timeout: 5) { ::Redis.new(host: '192.168.10.10', port: 9000) }
  )
  config[:followers].per_page = 50
  config[:followers].delimeter = ','

end
```

#### Referencing Multiple Feeds

So how do you access the feed from your code?

Each configuration created above automatically generates a constant under the `ActiveFeed` namespace. When we called `config[:news_feed]`, the library created a constant that from now on point to this instance of the feed within the application: `ActivityFeed::NewsFeed`.

Second feed configuration would have generated `ActivityFeed::Followers`.


### Writing Data to the Feed

When we publish events to the feeds, we typically (although not always) do it for many feeds at the same time. This is why the write operations typically accept an array of users (or IDs)

```ruby
require 'active_feed'

# First we define list of users (or "owners") of the activity feed to be
# populated with the given event.
user_id_list = [1, 4, 545, 234234]

# Next, we instantiate the updater by passing the list of users,
# and then we publish the event across all of the corresponding feeds.
@feed = ActiveFeed::NewsFeed.new(user_id_list)
@feed.publish(sort: Time.now, event: event)
```

Instead of passing the list of user IDs, you can pass an AREL statement,
or a block which should return the next element in the array when called,
or nil when exhausted.

For any object types besides Integer, ActiveFeed will call a method
:to_af on the object, in order to receive a string representation of
that object.

```ruby
# This is just an example of how you could return AREL statement
# which can then be fetched in groups (pages) of users and split into
# several parallel jobs by ActiveFeed.

@feed = ActiveFeed::NewsFeed.new(User.where(follower: event.actor))
```

#### Writing Efficiently

For large data sets it is generally required to use batch operations, instead of looping for each user. If you are using Rails, then the corresponding method of interest is `#find_in_batches`, which can apply to any `ActiveRecord::Relation` instance. This method retrieves a batch of records and then yields the entire batch to the block as an array of models.

If you are not using Rails, you can still use any custom method that yields the entire batch to the block as an array of IDs or models.

```ruby
@feed = ActiveFeed::NewsFeed.new do
  User.where(followee: @event.actor).find_in_batches(batch_size: 1000) do |users|
    yield users
  end
end
# Will grab users in batches, and push news feed events to their feeds.
@feed.publish(sort: @event.timestamp, event: @event)
```

#### Event Serialization

Events can be pure ruby classes, but they must implement an instance method `#to_af`:

 * `#to_af` instance method, which would return a short representation of the event using a string and IDs related to it. For example, it can be a short delimited string, with a type and a few IDs identifying the event.

 * `#from_af` class method, which receives a string representation generated above, and reconstructs object associated with the event, needed for rendering it.

### Reading Data from the Feed

Given a user,

```ruby
  require 'active_feed/reader'

  reader = ActiveFeed::NewsFeed.new(User.where(username: 'kig').first)

  reader.paginate(page: 1, per_page: 20).map do |activity|
    event = ApplicationEvent.from_af(activity)  # returns a +UserLikedAStoryItem+ instance
    event.render(:json)                         # returns JSON string representation of the news feed item
  end.join(',')

```
